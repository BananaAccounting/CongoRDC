# Accounting reports for OHADA-RDC

The BananaApp [Accounting Reports (OHADA - RDC)](https://www.banana.ch/apps/fr/node/9093) creates a report with the following three documents:
* Balance Sheet
* Profit/Loss Statement
* Cash Flow

The app has been developed following the specific OHADA-RDC documentations:
* [Balance Sheet documentation](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/CongoRDC/blob/master/reports/statements/balancesheet/balancesheet_documentation.pdf)
* [Profit/Loss Statement documentation](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/CongoRDC/blob/master/reports/statements/profitlossstatement/profitlosstatement_documentation.pdf)
* [Cash Flow documentation](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/CongoRDC/blob/master/reports/statements/cashflow/cashflow_documentation.pdf)

In the documentations, the syntax used to specify which data to use is **{account/group,column}**, where:
* **account/group**: indicates the account or group of the Accounts table in Banana (groups begins with **Gr=**);
* **column**: indicates the type of data (Opening, Debit, Credit, Total(debit-credit)) of the Accounts table in Banana;
* **(-1)**: indicates that the value must be inverted. If positive inverts to a negative value, if negative inverts to a positive value.
